=========  Day-1 Intro of reactjs =========

=> welcome to react.js 

-> what is module.

    Module are nothing but resuable pieces of code.
    They can be ecxported from a paticular file where they are present and then can be used in other files with the help of import statements. This make it very easy to maintain large js files.

    - main.js [entry] and [import {count} from './counter.js'] and [import {render} from './display.js]

    - counter.js 
    - display.js


-> what is npm.

    n=Node
    p=Package
    m=Manager

    So basically NPM is also just like that, people have built thouand and thousand of libraries over there which are open-source and free which you can include them in your project as per your own convenience.

    This website link is - npmjs.org

-> what is react.js.
    React is a clinet side js library which helps to build user interfaces in terms of components.

    1. it was release in may 2013
    2. it is maintained by facebook and some other independent developer 
    3. it is the fastest growing Javascript library
    4. majority of the website are now built on reactjs [twitter, netflix, instagram.]

-> what us DOM.
    The Document Object Model [DOM] is a programming API for HTML and XML document. it defines the logical sturcture of document and the way a document is accessed and manipulated The DOM mostly follows a tree data structure. Every time there is a change to represent that change. Now catch is frequently manipulating the DOM affects performence, making it slow.

    SHORT-COMMING of DOM
        The Document Object Model [DOM] is generally represented by a tree data structure. This allow us to update and make changes to the DOM in a fast and efficient manner. But after the change, the updated element and it's children have to be re-rendered to update the application UI. The re-rendering of the enterie UI make it slow. Therefore as soon as you start having more UI components in your application, the DOM traversal and updation start becomeing expensive.


    REACT VERTUAL DOM
        The React virtual DOM is nothing but a virtual representation of the real DOM. So basically whenever the state of our application changes, the virtual DOM gets updated instead of the real DOM.


    BENEFITS of  REACT Virtual DOM
        When new element are added to the UI, a VERTUAL DOM, which is represented as a tree is created. Each element is a node on this tree. if the state of any od these element changes, a new virtual DOM tree is created. this tree is then compared with the previous virtual DOM tree.

        Once this is done, the virtual DOM calcualtes the best possible method to make these change to the real DOM. This ensures that there are minimal operations on the real DOM, hence, reducing the performance cost of updating the real DOM. 
         

-> what is babel.

    Babel is a nothing but a js transpiler that conver js code with new ES version into old onces. Transpiler are tools that generally read source code written in one programming language, and product the equivalent code in another language.
 
-> what is webpack.
    Webpack is a module bundler for js application. it enables you to write you code in modules and it package all the modules into one [or more] bundle.
