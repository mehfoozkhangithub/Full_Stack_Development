// this class is how js work

//! what is hoisting?

/**
 * steps1 we have to go in python tutor
 *
 * --> inside this we have to check how hoisting work
 *
 * --> write block for the code
 *
 * var msg="hello"
 *
 * console.log(msg)
 *
 * 1. we get
 *
 *  msg=undefine
 *
 *  msg=hello
 *
 * * so we getting the value  after assign the var name or key-word
 * *
 *
 *
 * ? the we have to check the understand the position of assign
 *
 * console.log(msg)
 *
 * var msg;
 *
 * msg="hello"
 *
 * console.log(msg)
 *
 *
 * todo :-  js raises the value on top and that is hoisting [legit attendance]. every variable `undefined` in the creation phase and hoisting is only for js not for other programming language
