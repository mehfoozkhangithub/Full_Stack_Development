Authentication :- It's just a way of Identifying who someone is

Authorization :- is a way of the determining what access dose someone have


Authentication:-  
                1. Signup: create-Asccounts/ register
                    email:
                    password: 
                       store in DB

                2. login
                    email:
                    password
                        email&&password is coorrect ? login succefull : login failed
            
                3. Authenticated services/endpoints
                    /weather 
                    /purches


                    a.  we'll make the login at every protect points.
                        1. you are  annoying  the user/not the right user  experience
                        2. not an optional way, querying db's user collection again and again

                    b. token
                        when someone login in successfully, we give them a token-"abc123"
                        we'll check the token when they visit the protected endpoints
                        if token is correct? "give that endpoint access":"login again"

                    Token 
                        "abc123"- for everyone who login in successfully
                            - token is not uniqe per user
                            - Math.random()
                            - bruteforcing



                    The Solution - JWT - http://jwr.io/

                    1. Algorithm used 
                    2. is some data - optional
                    3. secret key;

                    1. Install jsonwebtoken package
                    
                4. Having Password in the plain-text:
                    1. anyone with access to DB can see the password and can missuse it 
                    2. in case of the data dumps, password shouldn't be missuse.

                
                5. bycript
                    1. abc ->myza -> store in DB
                    2. login -> abd, myza => compare()=> false
                
                more the no of rounds = more secure the password 



here some command we expore 

copy the same dir file/folder use this -> [cp "folder wnat to copy" "patch whom to paste"]  "cp -r model/ config/ routes/  /d/NetTech/movie_api_app/Backend/Day-12"


move the file to diff dir  -> [mv "file name and folder ame" "path u want to past"]  mv * /d/NetTech/movie_api_app/Backend/Day-13
